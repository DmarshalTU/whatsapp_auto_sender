# Welcome to **AutoWTS** guide! 
**AutoWTS** its an aoutumated and siple way to send bulk meseggaes to contacts from a file via WhatsApp Web messenger.

The project folder content:
- AutoWTS
  - *.idea* 
  - **assets** : Here is your images, groups and message text files.
  - *web_drivers* : Here is the web drivers for Chrome and Firefox browser
  - **whatsapp** : The main folder
  - *README*

To start using the application go to the *assets* folder and set the groups and message
file(**gr.txt**, **ms.txt**), if you want to send images copy it to that folder and name it *im.jpg*.

Now more thing that left is to open the cmd with *WIN+r*, type in cmd press *ENTER*, type *python* with space after it and 
drag the *whatsapp.py* from the *whatsapp* folder there, press *ENTER* and watch the magic happened.

### The last thing to do is to chose the mode that you want and press *ENTER*.
